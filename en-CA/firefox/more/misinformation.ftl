misinformation-page-title = Avoid misinformation online – { -brand-name-firefox } is here to help
misinformation-page-desc = Misinformation is annoying, distracting and expensive. { -brand-name-firefox } has some tips for avoiding false information – and seeing less of it when browsing the web.

misinformation-what-is-heading = What is misinformation? What is disinformation?
misinformation-disinformation = Misinformation, disinformation – you’ve probably heard these terms in the past and wondered if and how they differ in meaning. It’s the intention that distinguishes them: Misinformation is any type of false information that people might fall for. It’s verifiably incorrect or misleading but hasn’t been created or shared with the intention to deceive people. Disinformation, on the other hand, is created and spread in order to misinform and reach a certain goal.
misinformation-ultimately-harmful = Ultimately, both misinformation and disinformation can be harmful. It’s not only that people will believe incorrect information, false information costs the global economy a lot of money and can threaten democracy and efficient governance. And it’s difficult to stop because false news spreads significantly faster, deeper and more broadly than news that is correct.
misinformation-false-info-heading = Where does false information show up?
