# HTML page title and main title
vpn-when-to-use-5-reasons-you-should = 5 reasons you should use a VPN
# HTML page description and intro
vpn-when-to-use-here-are-five = Here are five situations a trustworthy VPN will come in handy that you might not have considered. Close the gap in your online security with { -brand-name-mozilla-vpn }.
# Variables
#   $vpn (url) - https://www.mozilla.org/products/vpn/more/what-is-a-vpn/
vpn-when-to-use-as-more-of = As more of daily life takes place across internet connections, privacy and security issues become even more important. A VPN — <a href="{ $vpn }">Virtual Private Network</a> — can help anyone create a secure, private connection to the internet. It works by creating a secure “tunnel” between your device and the internet at large, and it protects you in two important ways:
vpn-when-to-use-concealing-your-true = Concealing your true IP address, which protects your identity and obscures your location.
vpn-when-to-use-encrypting-your-traffic = Encrypting your traffic between you and your VPN provider so that no one on your local network can decipher or modify it.
vpn-when-to-use-having-a-vpn = Having a VPN at your fingertips when you need it is a good idea. Here are a few times having a trustworthy VPN will come in handy that you might not have considered.
vpn-when-to-use-1-a-walk = 1. A walk in the park
vpn-when-to-use-its-a-beautiful = It’s a beautiful Saturday morning, and you’ve settled down on a park bench to sip a coffee and catch up on your favorite news sites, watch a few videos and do some quick online shopping while getting sun and fresh air. Rather than draining your allotted mobile data, you hop onto your city’s public WiFi service. It’s free, and run by the city, so it must be ok, right? The fact is, you can’t be certain the municipal network is secure or even real (see the next point) and set up to protect you from malicious people or entities spying on you while you’re connected. Turning on a VPN can help protect your device from anyone who tries to snoop on the sites you’re visiting or hijack your sensitive login information while you’re kicked back on that park bench any day of the week.
vpn-when-to-use-2-in-the = 2. In the neighbourhood

# "C0MCAST-WiFi-77th-St" and "Verizon3-Hotspot-Baltimore" are examples of possibly suspicious public wifi networks. You can substitute similar example names for your locale.
# "legit" is shortened slang for "legitimate"
vpn-when-to-use-have-you-ever = Have you ever connected to a hotspot called something like <em>C0MCAST-WiFi-77th-St</em> or <em>Verizon3-Hotspot-Baltimore</em>? Looks legit, right? Not so fast. In reality, anyone can set up a phony public WiFi with a legitimate sounding name to lure people to use it. Connecting to any unknown WiFi makes you an easy target for creeps and criminals who want to access your device to steal private information, install malware or worse. <a href="{ $mozvpn }">{ -brand-name-mozilla-vpn }</a> can boost your security any time you’re connected to a public WiFi by blocking unknown entities from seeing private data that travels from your phone or laptop. This goes for connecting to WiFi networks at coffee shops, stores, doctor’s offices and so on.
vpn-when-to-use-3-on-the = 3. On the go
vpn-when-to-use-open-wifi-abounds = Open WiFi abounds when you’re on the go, from networked buses to hotspots in train stations to the free airport internet. And no matter how secure they seem to be, treat these WiFi hotspots with care and suspicion. Many of us will use these free connections at times for convenience, yet all the same risks outlined in this article apply to any open, unverified WiFi network. Using a VPN can help protect your identity, file transfers and online activities from bad actors attempting to spy on you through the same WiFi network.
